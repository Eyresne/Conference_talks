Repo for talks I've given at conferences, Meetups, and luncheons.

## ODSC_East_2018_GANs

"Latest Developments in GANs" talk to be given at ODSC East on May 4, 2018.

## ODSC_West_2017_Deep_Learning

"Deep Learning from Scratch using Python" talk given on November 4, 2017 at ODSC West. [Here](https://odsc.com/training/portfolio/deep-learning-scratch-using-python) is a link to the talk description, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO-RRjG45X8) is a link to the video of the talk.

In the talk, I walk through the RISE-powered Jupyter notebook [here](ODSC_West_2017_Deep_Learning/ODSC_Deep_Learning_2017.ipynb). To see the talk as it was presented, clone this repo, install [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), open up the notebook as a RISE presentation and enjoy!

## Chicago_Statistical_Association_Neural_Nets

"Neural Nets: What Are They? And Should We Be Scared of Them?" talk given on September 12, 2017 at the Chicago Chapter of the American Statistical Association. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cwIDAb3X7Q) is a video of the talk.

This Keynote presentation has a ton of animations, so I recommend you clone this repo, open up the presentation in Keynote, and step through it in presenter mode.

## Boston_2018_GANs

A work-in-progress talk to be delivered on February 1, 2018 at the [Boston Deep Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Deep-Learning-Meetup).
