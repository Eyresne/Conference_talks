# AirBNB_Lunch_July_2018

An introduction to GANs, delivered at the AirBNB office in San Francisco in July 2018.

The [`GANs_Presentation.ipynb`](GANs_Presentation.ipynb) notebook contains the talk. It is designed to be viewed using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).

The steps to walk through the talk are:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:SethHWeidman/ODSC_Neural_Nets_11-04-17.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) repository to download RISE and configure it correctly as a Jupyter extension.
3. Open a Jupyter Notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
4. Begin slideshow mode.

You may first need to install Jupyter; if so, see [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html) for instructions.

Enjoy!
